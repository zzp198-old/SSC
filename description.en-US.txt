[h1]Quality of Service[/h1]

This mod is mainly used in the multiplayer. All the following functions are turned off by default. Please turn them on as needed.
It is recommended to use the "Minecraft" material package. In addition to high-quality content, it is easier to judge the collision body of the boss (especially slime.JPG).

[h2]Smooth Effect[/h2]

In multiplayer, special effects and bullet screens often make you unable to see the boss's attack clearly.
After being turned on, you can shield friendly bullets and special effects (including four pillars and alien detectors).

[h2]Revive Seal[/h2]

Once you have been close enough to the boss (roughly the display distance of the blood bar), you will be cursed and cannot be revived before the boss disappears.
At the same time, "SSC" will be restricted, and login will be prohibited when BOSS exists to prevent from being revived.

[h2]Observation[/h2]

When you die, you can watch the boss/boss target, left click to switch the boss, and right click to switch the watching mode.
If "Revive Seal" is enabled, you will have priority to watch the boss/boss target that applies the resurrection curse to you.
You are not allowed to watch other players directly.

If you have better ideas about the multiplayer mode, you are welcome to put forward the issue.
