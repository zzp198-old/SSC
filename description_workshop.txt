SSC(Server Side Character) is a special mechanism designed for tModLoader servers that forces players to start with fresh characters when they join.
This means they lose all of their items. Though, it will not affect their actual Single player character.
Server Side Character are what you need if you wish to prevent people from bringing in items from other servers and/or single player and force them to start from scratch.
