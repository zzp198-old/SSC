Mod name: SSC (Server Side Character)

If you have used TShock, you must be familiar with this mod.

When you enter the world, your local player will be erased.
Don't worry, this won't cause any damage to your local archive.

Still, your Steam account is your only voucher.
There can be multiple players under your Steam account name.

Command List:
    1. /SSC list
        all your player information will be returned.
    2. /SSC add name difficulty
        add a new player to your Steam account name.
    3. /SSC [number]


Future:
    Add UI, similar to player select interface, for convenience.
    (In fact, it has been implemented, but the interface layout is too ugly,
     and it will make the client-server interaction more complex.
     This scheme is not enabled for the time being.)
