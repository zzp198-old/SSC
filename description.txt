Mod name: SSC (Server Side Character)

If you have used TShock, you must be familiar with this mod.

When you enter the world, your local player will be erased.
Don't worry, this won't cause any damage to your local archive.

Still, your Steam account is your only voucher.
There can be multiple players under your Steam account name.

Note: In order to ensure that the archive will not be lost,
SteamID is used instead of ClientUUID, which means that you must use steam to log in.
(it may make GOG players unable to use it normally. Just guess, to be verified.)

Command List:
    1. /SSC list
        all your player information will be returned.
    2. /SSC add [name] difficulty[0/classic,1/mediumcore,2/hardcore,3/journey]
        add a new player to your Steam account name.
    3. /SSC use [number]
        select a player that in your list and play.
    4. /SSC del [number]
        delete a player that in your list.

Save location: [tModLoader]/SSC/Server/[SteamID]/
There will be "plr", "tplr", "map" and "tmap" files, which can be copied and pasted directly.

Known Issues:
    1.After the map synchronization function is written,
    it is found that the map cannot be synchronized normally.To be solved.

    2.There is a maximum limit of 64KB for data transmission at one time.
    When there is too much player data, it cannot be saved normally.
    For this reason, the "server side map" has to be cancelled temporarily,
    and subcontracting may be used to solve this problem in the future.

Future:
    Add UI, similar to player select interface, for convenience.
    (In fact, it has been implemented, but the interface layout is too ugly,
    and it will make the client-server interaction more complex.
    This scheme is not enabled for the time being.)
    
The new version has not been fully tested, which can only ensure that the normal process is correct.
